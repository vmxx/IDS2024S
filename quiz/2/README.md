1. Cache is the fastest part of the computer memory
2.  The benefit of this hierarchical memory layout is that the CPU can predict and prefetch the future data or instructions from the slower but larger levels of memory hierarchy to the higher levels for subsequent usage by the CPU for computations.
3.  Disk is the slowest part of the storage device in computers
4.  Disk, DRAM, L3 cache, L2 cache, L1 cache, Registers
5.  Bit is smallest
6.  Binary is easier for computers to process
7.  The closer to the processor, the memory access speed increases. However, the memory size also shrinks
8.  1945
9.  1945
10.  A fixed computer can only perform the algorithms for which they had been physically wired and built.
11.  desk calculator
12.  declarative knowledge involves statements of fact while imperative is about how to accomplish something
13.  a,c,d,e is declarative while b is imperative
14.  declarative, and imperative (procedural)
15.  ENIAC
16.  Python
17.  FORTRAN
18. + they must contain a main procedure that determines the control flow for the program  
+ they must contain a set of functions that are called to perform certain tasks during program execution  
+ the main and sub-main procedures have a hierarchical structure  
+ the source code for each procedure is compiled  
+ all compiled procedures and the main procedure are linked together with other source codes to produce a complete executable program
