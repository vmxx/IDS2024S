2. Experiment, Theory, Computation+Data
3. + a workflow bridging data, hypothesis/theory, and prediction (predictive computing)
   + a substitute for experiment and observational data, where it is not available (numerical simulation)
   + a substitute for theory, where it is not available (data-driven discovery via machine learning, deep learning, …)
4.  Deductive and plausible reasoning  
+ deductive logic, a proposition is a statement that can be either true or false; it must be one or the other, and it cannot be both  
+ plausible reasoning, if a is true then b is true. if b is true therefore a becomes more plausible  
5.  logical implication and physical causation are NOT the same. rain at 10 am is not the physical cause of the clouds at 9:45 am
