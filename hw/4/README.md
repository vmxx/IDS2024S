7. (I) Degrees of plausibility are represented by real numbers.  
(II) Qualitative correspondence with common sense.  
(III) Consistency.  
+ (I) If a conclusion can be reasoned out in more than one way, then every possible way
must lead to the same result.
+ (II) We must always consider all the evidence relevant to a question. We should not
arbitrarily ignore some information, basing the conclusions only on what remains.
+ (III) We must always represent equivalent states of knowledge by equivalent
plausibility assignments. That is, if the state of knowledge is the same (except
perhaps for labeling the propositions) in two problems, then it must assign the
same plausibilities in both.
