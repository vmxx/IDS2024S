2.  ENIAC stands for Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer  
3.  Binary is easier for computers to process  
4.  Cache is the fastest part of the computer memory  -
5.  Disk is the slowest part of the storage device in computers  
6.  A bit (binary digit) is the smallest unit of data  
7.  (A) Assembly is the programming language to machine code (i.e., binary code)
(B) No  
8.  (A) Fortran is the oldest high-level programming language that is still in active daily use.
(B) Fortran was made in 19573  
9.  (A) Assembly is a second-generation programming language.
(B) Fortran:Third, C:Third, C++; third, MATLAB:fourth, Python:fourth, R:fourth  
10.  C was made in 1972, C++ was made in 1985, Python was made in 1991, MATLAB was made in 1984
11.  BCPL was an ancestor programming language of C
12.  C is the programming language ancestor of C++
13.  Fortran/C is a programming language ancestor of MATLAB and Python.
14.  Registers are fastest part of the memory in the memory hierarchy of modern computers
15.  Bits are typically the smallest memory unit in the memory hierarchy of modern computers
16.  registers process in clock cycles while RAM process in nanoseconds, with registers have data transfer rates much faster than RAM
17.  RAM process in nanoseconds, while SSD process in microseconds. 
18.  RAM process in nanoseconds, while HDD process in milliseconds. 
19.  In a computer microchip, transistors act as switches, letting current through to represent the binary digit 1, or cutting it off to represent 0
20.  It is costly, and takes alot of power with diminishing returns
21.  The three tasks are the fetch stage, the decode stage, and the execute stage.
22.   Yes, despite having more clock cycles, other factors such as multithreading and memory allocation can make it slower than a PC with less clock cycles
23.   In modern PC, memory access is the bottle neck in terms of PC speeds. Accessing memory takes time among other factors involving memory.
24.   Dennard Scaling refers to the principles that describes how performance and power efficiency of semiconductor devices could improve as transistor dimensions shrink  
MOSFET(Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor) Scaling refers to improving performance, increasing transistor density, and reducing manufacturing cost by shrinking the dimensions of MOSFET transistors.  
Mooreâ€™s Law states that the number of transistors in integrated circuits doubles approximately every two years, leading to increase in performance and capabilities.
